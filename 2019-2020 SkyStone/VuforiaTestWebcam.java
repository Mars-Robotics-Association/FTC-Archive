/**
 * This 2016-2017 OpMode illustrates the basics of using the Vuforia localizer to determine
 * positioning and orientation of robot on the FTC field.
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * Vuforia uses the phone's camera to inspect it's surroundings, and attempt to locate target images.
 *
 * When images are located, Vuforia is able to determine the position and orientation of the
 * image relative to the camera.  This sample code than combines that information with a
 * knowledge of where the target images are on the field, to determine the location of the camera.
 *
 * This example assumes a "diamond" field configuration where the red and blue alliance stations
 * are adjacent on the corner of the field furthest from the audience.
 * From the Audience perspective, the Red driver station is on the right.
 * The two vision target are located on the two walls closest to the audience, facing in.
 * The Stones are on the RED side of the field, and the Chips are on the Blue side.
 *
 * A final calculation then uses the location of the camera on the robot to determine the
 * robot's location and orientation on the field.
 *
 * @see VuforiaLocalizer
 * @see VuforiaTrackableDefaultListener
 * see  ftc_app/doc/tutorial/FTC_FieldCoordinateSystemDefinition.pdf
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: In order to use this OpMode, you need to obtain your own Vuforia license key as
 * is explained below.

        /**
         * We also need to tell Vuforia where the <em>cameras</em> are relative to the robot.
         *
         * Just as there is a Field Coordinate System, so too there is a Robot Coordinate System.
         * The two share many similarities. The origin of the Robot Coordinate System is wherever
         * you choose to make it on the robot, but typically you'd choose somewhere in the middle
         * of the robot. From that origin, the Y axis is horizontal and positive out towards the
         * "front" of the robot (however you choose "front" to be defined), the X axis is horizontal
         * and positive out towards the "right" of the robot (i.e.: 90deg horizontally clockwise from
         * the positive Y axis), and the Z axis is vertical towards the sky.
         *
         * Similarly, for each camera there is a Camera Coordinate System. The origin of a Camera
         * Coordinate System lies in the middle of the sensor inside of the camera. The Z axis is
         * positive coming out of the lens of the camera in a direction perpendicular to the plane
         * of the sensor. When looking at the face of the lens of the camera (down the positive Z
         * axis), the X axis is positive off to the right in the plane of the sensor, and the Y axis
         * is positive out the top of the lens in the plane of the sensor at 90 horizontally
         * counter clockwise from the X axis.
         *
         * Next, there is Phone Coordinate System (for robots that have phones, of course), though
         * with the advent of Vuforia support for Webcams, this coordinate system is less significant
         * than it was previously. The Phone Coordinate System is defined thusly: with the phone in
         * flat front of you in portrait mode (i.e. as it is when running the robot controller app)
         * and you are staring straight at the face of the phone,
         *     * X is positive heading off to your right,
         *     * Y is positive heading up through the top edge of the phone, and
         *     * Z is pointing out of the screen, toward you.
         * The origin of the Phone Coordinate System is at the origin of the Camera Coordinate System
         * of the front-facing camera on the phone.
         *
         * Finally, it is worth noting that trackable Vuforia Image Targets have their <em>own</em>
         * coordinate system (see {@link VuforiaTrackable}. This is sometimes referred to as the
         * Target Coordinate System. In keeping with the above, when looking at the target in its
         * natural orientation, in the Target Coodinate System
         *     * X is positive heading off to your right,
         *     * Y is positive heading up through the top edge of the target, and
         *     * Z is pointing out of the target, toward you.
         *
         * One can observe that the Camera Coordinate System of the front-facing camera on a phone
         * coincides with the Phone Coordinate System. Further, when a phone is placed on its back
         * at the origin of the Robot Coordinate System and aligned appropriately, those coordinate
         * systems also coincide with the Robot Coordinate System. Got it?
         *
         * In this example here, we're going to assume that we put the camera on the right side
         * of the robot (facing outwards, of course). To determine the transformation matrix that
         * describes that location, first consider the camera as lying on its back at the origin
         * of the Robot Coordinate System such that the Camera Coordinate System and Robot Coordinate
         * System coincide. Then the transformation we need is
         *      * first a rotation of the camera by +90deg along the robot X axis,
         *      * then a rotation of the camera by +90deg along the robot Z axis, and
         *      * finally a translation of the camera to the side of the robot.
         *
         * When determining whether a rotation is positive or negative, consider yourself as looking
         * down the (positive) axis of rotation from the positive towards the origin. Positive rotations
         * are then CCW, and negative rotations CW. An example: consider looking down the positive Z
         * axis towards the origin. A positive rotation about Z (ie: a rotation parallel to the the X-Y
         * plane) is then CCW, as one would normally expect from the usual classic 2D geometry.
